%input/output: %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% There are two possibilities to get an input graph:
% 1. Read a graph from file (in Chaco format)
%    In this case, the GraphKind field (below) should be filled with "unknown"
% 2. Generate a graph (and write it to a file)
%    You should choose the graph kind, and also the size(s) relevant to the graph
%    The graph will be written to the Inputfile (see below)
%    NOTE: prior contents of Inputfile will be erased 

GraphKind: unknown % possibilities: unknown,grid,folded_grid,partial_grid,
			       % partial_folded_grid,circle,tree,torus,cylinder,sierpinski 
				   % hypercube default: unknown

GraphSize1: 200 % default: -1

GraphSize2: 200  % default: -1

% input filename in Chaco's format, default: graph.graph:
Inputfile: D:\GraphCollections\walshaw\4970.graph  

% File of the computed coordinates, default: input file with '.coords' extension
Outputfile: D:\GraphCollections\temp.layout 

WeightVerticesByDegrees: false % True/False default: False

ShowStatistics: true % True / False  default: False

ShowWarnings: true % True / False  default: False

StatisticsFile: D:\GraphCollections\stats1.txt % filename, omitting this line means: 
											   % "print to the screen", default: empty

% The eigenvectors with which the x and y axes should be associated:

% Tolerances of Power Iteration and RQI
% One can use both methods (First PI and then RQI)
% or each one of them

% a negtive or zero value here means: "no power iteration"
PowerIterationTolerance: 1e-7 

% a negtive or zero value here means: "no RQI"
RqiTolerance: 1e-3 

 % Find directly the eigenpairs of graphs smaller than the following size:
MinSizeToCoarsen: 100 % default: 50

CoarseningMethod: Contraction  % Weighted, Contraction, default: weighted

% Frequency of refinement: E.g., 1 - each level 2 - each 2 levels
LevelsBetweenRefinements: 1

NumPasses: 2 % number of sweeps through permuted nodes list, default: 2
MinConnectivity: 0.05 % during the first sweep add to the rep's each nodes whose relative  
					  %	connectivity to the already chosen rep's is less than MinConnectivity
					  %	default: 0.05		

% in each additional pass increase MinConnectivity by ConnectivityGrowth:
ConnectivityGrowth: 0.05 %default: 0.05
